searchengines
=============

Back when we first started addons.mozilla.org we had a pile of search engines on
it that weren't associated with any developers.  Then we started requiring a
developer associated with add-ons but no one knew who made the add-ons.  So, I
associated all of them with my account, and voila - here we are.

All are MIT licensed.
